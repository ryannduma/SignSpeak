# SignSpeak System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the SignSpeak application, a real-time sign language translator leveraging computer vision, neural networks, and large language models.

## System Overview

SignSpeak is designed as a modular system with clearly separated components for sign recognition, translation between sign language and natural language, and sign language generation via avatars.

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture_diagram.png)

The system consists of these main components:

1. **Sign Recognition**: Processes video input to detect and interpret sign language
2. **Translation**: Converts between sign language and natural language text
3. **Sign Generation**: Generates sign language animations from text input
4. **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Sign Recognition

**Purpose**: Detect and recognize sign language gestures from video input.

**Key Files**:
- `src/sign_recognition/detector.py`: Main class for pose detection and sign recognition
- `src/models/sign_recognition_model.pth`: Pre-trained neural network model (to be implemented)

**Workflow**:
1. Video frame is captured from a webcam or video source
2. MediaPipe Holistic model extracts pose, hand, and face landmarks
3. Landmarks are processed and passed to a sign recognition model
4. The model classifies the landmarks into sign language gestures
5. Recognized signs are passed to the translation component

**Technologies**:
- MediaPipe for pose estimation
- PyTorch for the sign recognition model
- OpenCV for video processing

### 2. Translation

**Purpose**: Convert between sign language and natural language text.

**Key Files**:
- `src/translation/translator.py`: Handles translation using LLMs or rule-based methods
- `src/translation/speech.py`: Text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality (to be implemented)

**Workflow**:
1. Receives sign tokens from the recognition component
2. Uses context from previous translations to improve accuracy
3. Queries an LLM (OpenAI or Hugging Face) or uses a rule-based system
4. Returns natural language translation
5. For text-to-sign, performs the reverse operation

**Technologies**:
- OpenAI API for LLM-based translation
- Hugging Face Transformers for local translation options
- Rule-based fallback system for offline operation

### 3. Sign Generation

**Purpose**: Generate sign language animations from text input.

**Key Files**:
- `src/sign_generation/generator.py`: Converts text to sign animation sequences
- `src/sign_generation/avatar.py`: Handles avatar rendering and animation (to be implemented)

**Workflow**:
1. Receives text input from user or speech-to-text component
2. Converts text to sign language tokens using NLP techniques
3. Maps tokens to animation sequences
4. Renders animations using an avatar system

**Technologies**:
- Animation system (to be determined)
- Token-to-animation mapping database
- Potentially 3D rendering for realistic avatars

### 4. User Interface

**Purpose**: Provide intuitive interfaces for user interaction.

**Key Files**:
- `src/app.py`: Main desktop application
- `src/streamlit_app.py`: Web-based interface using Streamlit

**Features**:
- Real-time webcam feed with sign recognition
- Translation display
- Text input for text-to-sign translation
- Settings and configuration options

**Technologies**:
- Streamlit for web interface
- OpenCV for desktop UI (via native windows)
- Potentially Flask for more advanced web interfaces

## Data Flow

1. **Sign-to-Text Flow**:
   ```
   Webcam → Video Frames → MediaPipe → Keypoints → Sign Recognition Model → 
   Sign Tokens → LLM Translation → Natural Language Text → Display/TTS
   ```

2. **Text-to-Sign Flow**:
   ```
   Text Input/Speech → Text Processing → Sign Language Tokens → 
   Animation Sequences → Avatar Rendering → Display
   ```

## Development Roadmap

1. **Initial MVP (Current)**:
